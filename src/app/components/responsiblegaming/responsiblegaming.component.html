                    <p class="ng-scope" style="padding-top: 2%;">We recommend you think about the following hints, before gambling in order to insure gambling stays fun for You and without any negative side effects: </p> 
                    <p class="ng-scope">Set yourself a deposit limit 
                        Before you startto gambling think about how much you can afford to gamble with according to Your financial situation. Play with amounts which are for fun and for Your entertainment
                    </p> 
                    <p class="ng-scope">Do not try to win back a loss at every cost
                        Try to not take to huge risks to win back what You lost before at any cost. Play for Entertainment and not to earn money.
                    </p> 
                    <p class="ng-scope">Set yourself a time limit 
                        Set yourself a time limit and do not break it. Keep in mind gambling should stay in balance with your other hobbies and not be Your only hobby. 
                    </p> 
                    <p class="ng-scope">Play smart:
                        It is smarter to not play, when You are extremely stressed, depressed or under to much pressure. Also do not play when you are under the influence of Medications, Drugs or Alcohol. 
                    </p> 
                    <p class="ng-scope">Take breaks: 
                        You should take breaks when You notice, that You get tired or can´t concentrate anymore
                    </p> 
                    <p class="ng-scope">Only one account:
                        To make it easier to have an overview how much time and money You spend on gambling it is highly advised to not create more than one Account per Person. 
                    </p> 
                    <p class="ng-scope" style="font-size: large;font-weight: bold;">Minor Protection </p> 
                    <p class="ng-scope" style="padding-top: 2%;">Principally we recommend a filter program to avoid minors, especially children, to access any context on the internet, which is not healthy for them.
                    </p> 
                    <p class="ng-scope" style="padding-top: 2%;"> 
                        For parents we can recommend a list of internet filters, to support them, from keeping their children from any context, which was not made for them:

                    </p> 
                    <p class="ng-scope" style="font-size: large;font-weight: bold;">Self-Exclusion:</p> 
                    <p class="ng-scope">In case You are diagnosed with a gambling addiction or try to stay away from gambling for a different reason, we want to assist you to stay away from anything, that does nothing good for you. “Self-Exclusion” means, that You exclude yourself, out of Your own choice, from all gambling services. This exclusion cannot be undone for a set amount of time. If you wish to self-exclude yourself from gambling, please message our support and give them a time span between 6 months and 5 years. They also will explain you all future steps and what is needed from you.</p>
